# DocNet: Document-level Relation Extraction as Semantic Segmentatio



This repository is the official implementation of [**DocuNet**](https://github.com/zjunlp/DocRE/), which is model proposed in a paper: **[Document-level Relation Extraction as Semantic Segmentation](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/551)**, accepted by **IJCAI2021** main conference.

# Brief Introduction
This paper innovatively proposes the DocuNet model, which first regards the document-level relation extraction as the semantic segmentation task in computer vision.


# Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Training

To train the DocuNet model in the paper on the dataset [DocRED](https://github.com/thunlp/DocRE), run this command:

```bash
>> bash scripts/run_docred.sh # use BERT/RoBERTa by setting --transformer-type
```

To train the DocuNet model in the paper on the dataset CDR and GDA, run this command:

```bash
>> bash scripts/run_cdr.sh  # for CDR
>> bash scripts/run_gda.sh  # for GDA
```



# Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model in the paper, you setting the `--load_path` argument in training scripts. The program will log the result of evaluation automatically. And for DocRED  it will generate a test file `result.json` in the official evaluation format. You can compress and submit it to Colab for the official test score.


# Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
